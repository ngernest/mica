(** Module signature / interface for hash tables *)
module type HashTableInf = sig
  (** [('k, 'v) t] is the type of mutable table-based maps that bind
      keys of type ['k] to values of type ['v]. *)
  type ('k, 'v) t

  (** [insert k v m] mutates map [m] to bind [k] to [v]. If [k] was
      already bound in [m], that binding is replaced by the binding to
      [v]. *)
  val insert : 'k -> 'v -> ('k, 'v) t -> unit

  (** [find k m] is [Some v] if [m] binds [k] to [v], and [None] if [m]
      does not bind [k]. *)
  val find : 'k -> ('k, 'v) t -> 'v option

  (** [remove k m] mutates [m] to remove any binding of [k]. If [k] was
      not bound in [m], the map is unchanged. *)
  val remove : 'k -> ('k, 'v) t -> unit

  (** [create hash c] creates a new table map with capacity [c] that
      will use [hash] as the function to convert keys to integers.
      Requires: The output of [hash] is always non-negative, and [hash]
      runs in constant time. *)
  val create : ('k -> int) -> int -> ('k, 'v) t

  (** [bindings m] is an association list containing the same bindings as [m]. *)
  val bindings : ('k, 'v) t -> ('k * 'v) list

  (** [of_list hash lst] creates a map with the same bindings as [lst],
      using [hash] as the hash function. Requires: [lst] does not
      contain any duplicate keys. *)
  val of_list : ('k -> int) -> ('k * 'v) list -> ('k, 'v) t
