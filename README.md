# Automated Property-Based Testing for OCaml Modules 

This repo contains a tool which parses any generic OCaml module signature, 
and checks whether two modules implementing the signature are observationally 
equivalent by generating random sequences of commands using Core.QuickCheck.

Documentation (generated with Odoc) located at: https://ngernest.github.io/module_pbt/

## Description of source files
- `lib/Parser.ml`: parser utility functions, modified from the Angstrom parser-combinator library
- `lib/ParserTypes.ml`: Datatypes defining an AST for module signatures
- `lib/ModuleParser.ml`: Parser for OCaml module signatures
- `lib/CodeGenerator.ml`: Takes a parsed AST representing a module signature and generates the appropriate PBT code 
- `lib/CmdLineParser.ml`: Parses user input from the command line
- `bin/main.ml`: Entry point for the executable for our tool

The `lib` directory also contains examples of the test harness adapted to work with the following modules:
- Finite sets (`lib/sets` subdirectory)
  - Signature: `SetInterface.ml`
  - Implementation using lists: `ListSet.ml` (adapted from Yale-NUS YSC2229 website)
  - Implementation using BSTs: `BSTSet.ml` (adapted from Penn CIS 1200 lecture notes)
  - PBT files automatically generated by our tool :      
  `lib/GeneratedSetPBTCode.ml` & `bin/GeneratedSetExecutable.ml`
- Stacks (`lib/stacks` subdirectory)
  - Signature: `StackInterface.ml`
  - Implementation using lists: `ListStack.ml` (adapted from Jane Street's Base library)
  - Implementation using custom ADTs: `VariantStack.ml` (adapted from Cornell CS 3110 textbook)
- Polynomials (`lib/polynomials` subdirectory)
  - Signature: `PolyInterface.ml`
  - Implementation using lists of tuples: `Poly1.ml` (adapted from Jean-Christophe Filliatre)
  - Implementation using lists of records: `Poly2.ml` (adapted from Shayne Fletcher)

## Building & running
This project compiles with `dune build`. 

**Usage**:       
`dune exec -- bin/main.exe [.ml file containing signature] [.ml file containing 1st module] [.ml file containing 2nd module]`
- This command runs our tool and creates two new files:
  1. `lib/Generated.ml` (contains PBT code for testing an OCaml module)
  2. `bin/compare_impls.ml` (code for an executable that tests two modules for observational equivalence)

To run the generated executable, run `dune exec -- bin/compare_impls.exe`. 

### Dependencies:
- [Base](https://github.com/janestreet/base)
- [Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core)
- [Core_unix](https://github.com/janestreet/core_unix)
- [Angstrom](https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom)
- [PPrint](https://github.com/fpottier/pprint)
- [Stdio](https://github.com/janestreet/stdio)


### Example (finite sets)
`dune exec -- bin/main.exe lib/sets/SetInterface.ml lib/sets/ListSet.ml lib/sets/BSTSet.ml`
This runs our tool on the Set example above, checking if the `ListSet` and `BSTSet` modules 
both correctly implement the interface `SetInterface`. 
The files `lib/GeneratedSetPBTCode.ml` and `lib/GeneratedSetExecutable.ml` contain PBT code that is 
automatically generated by our tool.
